# Twitter Scraping & Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to my personal project where I merge web scraping, natural language processing, and interactive data visualization to bring Twitter insights to life! This repository showcases an end-to-end solution that not only scrapes tweets in real-time but also performs sentiment analysis and topic modeling‚Äîall within a sleek, user-friendly dashboard.

## Overview

This project is designed to:

- **Scrape Tweets:** Automate the extraction of tweets from Twitter (X) using asynchronous Playwright.
- **Perform Sentiment Analysis:** Leverage a state-of-the-art transformer model (`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`) to classify tweets into Negative, Neutral, or Positive sentiments.
- **Store & Manage Data:** Utilize an SQLite database to store and manage tweet data for persistent analysis.
- **Preprocess & Analyze Text:** Clean and tokenize tweet texts with NLTK, and uncover hidden themes using LDA topic modeling and Word2Vec embeddings.
- **Visualize Data:** Create interactive charts and graphs with Plotly and Streamlit to explore trends and word distributions over time.
